<p>Greetings to everyone, I am MAITRI SINGH :)</p>
<p>My family consist of my father, mother, younger sister and brother.My family is very supportive in
every aspect.I feel blessed to have such parents and siblings who are always there for me in every 
situation.</p>
<p>Taking about myself I am a optimistic ,determined and self motivated person. My creativity and logical
thinking makes me unique and help me in problem solving. I give more importance to process than result.
For me result is the ultimate outcome of the hardwork we put into the task.</p>

<p>About my hobbies like things which gives me pleasure and fun are I love to ride my scooter at very 
high speed, yeah I know it's little dangerous but I feel free while driving speedily, I feel like 
I am flying. For me studies like food like we eat food to survive in the same manner solving maths
problem is same for me. If someone will ask me how much I love maths I can't tell I have no words to
explain my feelings. But one thing I am sure about is that if someday I have to leave my mathematics
forever I just, can't surrvive. </p>
<p>In free time I don't like sit to idle rather I enjoy playing badminton or reading some books as I 
love to know more so books are my best friends. I am very close to nature, I like to observe every 
little growth of my plant and get intense pleasure and happiness with their growth. Listening romantic 
music is not my cup of tea, but sometimes I do listen some bakti or patriotic songs.</p>

<p>I am proud of myself and for making a difference among others, I am happy and grateful for it. I am making my time count I am honest with myself I am good to those I care about.About my hobbies like things which gives me pleasure and fun are I love to ride my scooter at very high speed, yeah I know it's little dangerous but I feel free while driving speedily, I feel like I am flying. For me studies like food like we eat food to survive in the same manner solving maths problem is same for me. If someone will ask me how much I love maths I can't tell I have no words to explain my feelings. But one thing I am sure about is that if someday I have to leave my mathematics forever I just, can't surrvive.</p>
<p>The most easiest thing in whole, what I find, is sleeping. I can sleep anywhere in any conditon.
My mother is sweet, she is having childish behaviour what makes me love her more and more. So I was 
talking about her teachings like every morning when I wakes up before keeping my feet on ground I offer
 prayings to mother earth for carring our huge weight. She taught me to respect every creature whether 
big or small and every human beings irrespective of their background. She taught me to respect the air 
we breathe in, the water we take, the food that are easily available for us and all of above she taught 
me to love my nation more than my life.</p>
